## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **The Dev Tunnel resource failed to start**: Ensure that you have run `devtunnel login` and authenticated your account with Microsoft Dev Tunnels.
1. **There are missing resources listed on the Aspire dashboard**: Check that you completed the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) steps and all resources are deployed to Azure. Verify that the parameters have been added to the user secrets by opening a Terminal window and running `dotnet user-secrets list` in the AppHost project directory. It should contain the following values:

   ```
    Parameters:ResourceGroupName = ...
    Parameters:pg-password = ...
    Parameters:mcp-inspector-proxyToken = ...
    Parameters:FoundryResourceName = ...
    Parameters:FoundryProjectName = ...
    Parameters:FoundryEndpoint = ...
    Parameters:EmbeddingModelDeploymentName = ...
    Parameters:ChatModelDeploymentName = ...
    Parameters:AzureOpenAIEndpoint = ...
    ConnectionStrings:ApplicationInsights = ...
    Azure:Tenant = ...
    Azure:SubscriptionId = ...
    Azure:ResourceGroup = ...
    Azure:Location = ...
   ```
