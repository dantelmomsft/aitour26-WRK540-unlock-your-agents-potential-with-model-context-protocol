## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **The Dev Tunnel resource failed to start**: Ensure that you have run `devtunnel login` and authenticated your account with Microsoft Dev Tunnels.
1. **There are missing resources listed on the Aspire dashboard**: Check that you completed the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) steps and all resources are deployed to Azure. Verify that the parameters have been added to the user secrets by opening a Terminal window and running `dotnet user-secrets list` in the AppHost project directory. It should contain the following values:

   ```
    Parameters:ResourceGroupName = ...
    Parameters:pg-password = ...
    Parameters:mcp-inspector-proxyToken = ...
    Parameters:FoundryResourceName = ...
    Parameters:FoundryProjectName = ...
    Parameters:FoundryEndpoint = ...
    Parameters:EmbeddingModelDeploymentName = ...
    Parameters:ChatModelDeploymentName = ...
    Parameters:AzureOpenAIEndpoint = ...
    ConnectionStrings:ApplicationInsights = ...
    Azure:Tenant = ...
    Azure:SubscriptionId = ...
    Azure:ResourceGroup = ...
    Azure:Location = ...
   ```

1. **dotnet not supported when launching the debugger**: Ensure you install the C# extension in Visual Studio Code. If you have already installed it, try restarting Visual Studio Code.

1. **The Aspire dashboard does not load**: If the browser does not load, try hard-refreshing the page (Ctrl + F5 or Cmd + Shift + R). If it still does not load, ensure that the Dev Tunnel is running by checking the terminal window where you started the Dev Tunnel. If it is not running, navigate to the AppHost project directory and run `dotnet run` to start it again.

1. **The browser did not launch with the debugger**: Check the VS Code Debug Console for the URL `http://localhost:15184`. The Aspire dashboard uses a randomly generated key for authentication, which is included in the URL. Copy and paste the URL into your browser to access the Aspire dashboard. The terminal message looks like this:

   ```
   info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
         Now listening on: http://localhost:15184
   Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication: Information: Now listening on: http://localhost:15184
   info: Aspire.Hosting.DistributedApplication[0]
         Login to the dashboard at http://localhost:15184/login?t=<token>
   ```

1. **The `ai-foundry` resource reports _Failed to provision_.**: This can happen if the Azure connection fails to establish on the first run of the application. Restart the debugger in Visual Studio Code to try again.
